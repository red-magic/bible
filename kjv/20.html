<h2>Proverbs</h2>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>A wise <i>man</i> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood; they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>So <i>are</i> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>

<section>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <i>yea</i>, every good path.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>To deliver thee from the way of the evil <i>man</i>, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Who rejoice to do evil, <i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked, and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>To deliver thee from the strange woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>That thou mayest walk in the way of good <i>men</i>, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Happy <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> findeth wisdom, and the man <i>that</i> getteth understanding.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>The curse of the LORD <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For I was my father’s son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it</i> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing; <i>therefore</i> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Take fast hold of instruction; let <i>her</i> not go: keep her; for she <i>is</i> thy life.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men</i>.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For they <i>are</i> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>

<section>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>My son, attend unto my wisdom, <i>and</i> bow thine ear to my understanding:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <i>be</i> in the house of a stranger;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <i>and</i> rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup><i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>For the ways of man <i>are</i> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <i>of the hunter</i>, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Provideth her meat in the summer, <i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p><sup>10</sup><i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>These six <i>things</i> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Bind them continually upon thine heart, <i>and</i> tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp; and the law <i>is</i> light; and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For by means of a whorish woman <i>a man is brought</i> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup><i>Men</i> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>But <i>if</i> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup><i>But</i> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <i>that</i> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>For jealousy <i>is</i> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Say unto wisdom, Thou <i>art</i> my sister; and call understanding <i>thy</i> kinswoman:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And, behold, there met him a woman <i>with</i> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>(She <i>is</i> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Now <i>is she</i> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>So she caught him, and kissed him, <i>and</i> with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
<p><sup>14</sup><i>I have</i> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <i>works</i>, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>For the goodman <i>is</i> not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He hath taken a bag of money with him, <i>and</i> will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <i>is</i> for his life.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <i>men</i> have been slain by her.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Her house <i>is</i> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <i>is</i> to the sons of man.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <i>shall be</i> right things.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <i>is</i> an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>All the words of my mouth <i>are</i> in righteousness; <i>there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>They <i>are</i> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>For wisdom <i>is</i> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Counsel <i>is</i> mine, and sound wisdom: I <i>am</i> understanding; I have strength.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>By me princes rule, and nobles, <i>even</i> all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Riches and honour <i>are</i> with me; <i>yea</i>, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>When he prepared the heavens, I <i>was</i> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Then I was by him, <i>as</i> one brought up <i>with him</i>: and I was daily <i>his</i> delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <i>were</i> with the sons of men.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <i>are they that</i> keep my ways.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine <i>which</i> I have mingled.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <i>man getteth</i> himself a blot.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Give <i>instruction</i> to a wise <i>man</i>, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <i>man</i>, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <i>is</i> understanding.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <i>if</i> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>A foolish woman <i>is</i> clamorous: <i>she is</i> simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>To call passengers who go right on their ways:</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: and <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Stolen waters are sweet, and bread <i>eaten</i> in secret is pleasant.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>But he knoweth not that the dead <i>are</i> there; <i>and that</i> her guests <i>are</i> in the depths of hell.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <i>is</i> the heaviness of his mother.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>He becometh poor that dealeth <i>with</i> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>He that gathereth in summer <i>is</i> a wise son: <i>but</i> he that sleepeth in harvest <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Blessings <i>are</i> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The memory of the just <i>is</i> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The mouth of a righteous <i>man is</i> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod <i>is</i> for the back of him that is void of understanding.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Wise <i>men</i> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> near destruction.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The rich man’s wealth <i>is</i> his strong city: the destruction of the poor <i>is</i> their poverty.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The labour of the righteous <i>tendeth</i> to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He <i>is in</i> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>He that hideth hatred <i>with</i> lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, <i>is</i> a fool.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips <i>is</i> wise.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>The tongue of the just <i>is as</i> choice silver: the heart of the wicked <i>is</i> little worth.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup><i>It is</i> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>As the whirlwind passeth, so <i>is</i> the wicked no <i>more</i>: but the righteous <i>is</i> an everlasting foundation.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so <i>is</i> the sluggard to them that send him.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>The hope of the righteous <i>shall be</i> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>The way of the LORD <i>is</i> strength to the upright: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked <i>speaketh</i> frowardness.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>An hypocrite with <i>his</i> mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, <i>there is</i> shouting.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Where no counsel <i>is</i>, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellers <i>there is</i> safety.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>He that is surety for a stranger shall smart <i>for it</i>: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong <i>men</i> retain riches.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but <i>he that is</i> cruel troubleth his own flesh.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness <i>shall be</i> a sure reward.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>As righteousness <i>tendeth</i> to life: so he that pursueth evil <i>pursueth it</i> to his own death.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>They that are of a froward heart <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD: but <i>such as are</i> upright in <i>their</i> way <i>are</i> his delight.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup><i>Though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup><i>As</i> a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, <i>so is</i> a fair woman which is without discretion.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The desire of the righteous <i>is</i> only good: <i>but</i> the expectation of the wicked <i>is</i> wrath.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and <i>there is</i> that withholdeth more than is meet, but <i>it tendeth</i> to poverty.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing <i>shall be</i> upon the head of him that selleth <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool <i>shall be</i> servant to the wise of heart.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>The fruit of the righteous <i>is</i> a tree of life; and he that winneth souls <i>is</i> wise.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Deceit <i>is</i> in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellers of peace <i>is</i> joy.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Lying lips <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly <i>are</i> his delight.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Better <i>is</i> a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>A divine sentence <i>is</i> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>A just weight and balance <i>are</i> the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag <i>are</i> his work.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup><i>It is</i> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Righteous lips <i>are</i> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The wrath of a king <i>is as</i> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>In the light of the king’s countenance <i>is</i> life; and his favour <i>is</i> as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>How much better <i>is it</i> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The highway of the upright <i>is</i> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Pride <i>goeth</i> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Better <i>it is to be</i> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Understanding <i>is</i> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <i>is</i> folly.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Pleasant words <i>are as</i> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <i>there is</i> as a burning fire.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <i>that is</i> not good.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>The hoary head <i>is</i> a crown of glory, <i>if</i> it be found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup><i>He that is</i> slow to anger <i>is</i> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <i>is</i> of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Better <i>is</i> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <i>with</i> strife.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The fining pot <i>is</i> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <i>and</i> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <i>and</i> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Children’s children <i>are</i> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <i>are</i> their fathers.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>A gift <i>is as</i> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <i>very</i> friends.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>An evil <i>man</i> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The beginning of strife <i>is as</i> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Wherefore <i>is there</i> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <i>he hath</i> no heart <i>to it</i>?</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>A man void of understanding striketh hands, <i>and</i> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <i>and</i> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>He that begetteth a fool <i>doeth it</i> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>A merry heart doeth good <i>like</i> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>A wicked <i>man</i> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Wisdom <i>is</i> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <i>are</i> in the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>A foolish son <i>is</i> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Also to punish the just <i>is</i> not good, <i>nor</i> to strike princes for equity.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <i>and</i> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <i>and</i> he that shutteth his lips <i>is esteemed</i> a man of understanding.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <i>and</i> intermeddleth with all wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>When the wicked cometh, <i>then</i> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The words of a man’s mouth <i>are as</i> deep waters, <i>and</i> the wellspring of wisdom <i>as</i> a flowing brook.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup><i>It is</i> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>A fool’s mouth <i>is</i> his destruction, and his lips <i>are</i> the snare of his soul.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The name of the LORD <i>is</i> a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The rich man’s wealth <i>is</i> his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He that answereth a matter before he heareth <i>it</i>, it <i>is</i> folly and shame unto him.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup><i>He that is</i> first in his own cause <i>seemeth</i> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>A brother offended <i>is harder to be won</i> than a strong city: and <i>their</i> contentions <i>are</i> like the bars of a castle.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <i>and</i> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Death and life <i>are</i> in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup><i>Whoso</i> findeth a wife findeth a good <i>thing</i>, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>A man <i>that hath</i> friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend <i>that</i> sticketh closer than a brother.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Better <i>is</i> the poor that walketh in his integrity, than <i>he that is</i> perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Also, <i>that</i> the soul <i>be</i> without knowledge, <i>it is</i> not good; and he that hasteth with <i>his</i> feet sinneth.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall not escape.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man <i>is</i> a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth <i>them with</i> words, <i>yet</i> they <i>are</i> wanting <i>to him</i>.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall perish.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <i>it is</i> his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The king’s wrath <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <i>is</i> as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>A foolish son <i>is</i> the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife <i>are</i> a continual dropping.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>House and riches <i>are</i> the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife <i>is</i> from the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; <i>but</i> he that despiseth his ways shall die.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver <i>him</i>, yet thou must do it again.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup><i>There are</i> many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The desire of a man <i>is</i> his kindness: and a poor man <i>is</i> better than a liar.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The fear of the LORD <i>tendeth</i> to life: and <i>he that hath it</i> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>A slothful <i>man</i> hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>He that wasteth <i>his</i> father, <i>and</i> chaseth away <i>his</i> mother, <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <i>that causeth</i> to err from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Wine <i>is</i> a mocker, strong drink <i>is</i> raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The fear of a king <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion: <i>whoso</i> provoketh him to anger sinneth <i>against</i> his own soul.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><i>It is</i> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <i>therefore</i> shall he beg in harvest, and <i>have</i> nothing.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Counsel in the heart of man <i>is like</i> deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The just <i>man</i> walketh in his integrity: his children <i>are</i> blessed after him.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Divers weights, <i>and</i> divers measures, both of them <i>are</i> alike abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <i>be</i> pure, and whether <i>it be</i> right.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, <i>and</i> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup><i>It is</i> naught, <i>it is</i> naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge <i>are</i> a precious jewel.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Take his garment that is surety <i>for</i> a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Bread of deceit <i>is</i> sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup><i>Every</i> purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He that goeth about <i>as</i> a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>An inheritance <i>may be</i> gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Say not thou, I will recompense evil; <i>but</i> wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Divers weights <i>are</i> an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance <i>is</i> not good.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Man’s goings <i>are</i> of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</p>
<p><sup>25</sup><i>It is</i> a snare to the man <i>who</i> devoureth <i>that which is</i> holy, and after vows to make inquiry.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>The spirit of man <i>is</i> the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>The glory of young men <i>is</i> their strength: and the beauty of old men <i>is</i> the gray head.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Every way of a man <i>is</i> right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>To do justice and judgment <i>is</i> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>An high look, and a proud heart, <i>and</i> the plowing of the wicked, <i>is</i> sin.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The thoughts of the diligent <i>tend</i> only to plenteousness; but of every one <i>that is</i> hasty only to want.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange: but <i>as for</i> the pure, his work <i>is</i> right.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup><i>It is</i> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The righteous <i>man</i> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <i>but God</i> overthroweth the wicked for <i>their</i> wickedness.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup><i>It is</i> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He that loveth pleasure <i>shall be</i> a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The wicked <i>shall be</i> a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup><i>It is</i> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup><i>There is</i> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>A wise <i>man</i> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Proud <i>and</i> haughty scorner <i>is</i> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> abomination: how much more, <i>when</i> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <i>as for</i> the upright, he directeth his way.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup><i>There is</i> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>By humility <i>and</i> the fear of the LORD <i>are</i> riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <i>is</i> before thee:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <i>be</i> a man given to appetite.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <i>are</i> deceitful meat.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <i>riches</i> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Eat thou not the bread of <i>him that hath</i> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For as he thinketh in his heart, so <i>is</i> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <i>is</i> not with thee.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The morsel <i>which</i> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>Withhold not correction from the child: for <i>if</i> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Buy the truth, and sell <i>it</i> not; <i>also</i> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <i>child</i> shall have joy of him.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <i>when</i> it moveth itself aright.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>They have stricken me, <i>shalt thou say, and</i> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <i>and</i> I felt <i>it</i> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>A wise man <i>is</i> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellers <i>there is</i> safety.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Wisdom <i>is</i> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The thought of foolishness <i>is</i> sin: and the scorner <i>is</i> an abomination to men.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup><i>If</i> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <i>is</i> small.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>If thou forbear to deliver <i>them that are</i> drawn unto death, and <i>those that are</i> ready to be slain;</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <i>it</i>? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <i>not</i> he know <i>it</i>? and shall <i>not</i> he render to <i>every</i> man according to his works?</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>My son, eat thou honey, because <i>it is</i> good; and the honeycomb, <i>which is</i> sweet to thy taste:</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>So <i>shall</i> the knowledge of wisdom <i>be</i> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <i>it</i>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Lay not wait, O wicked <i>man</i>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For a just <i>man</i> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Lest the LORD see <i>it</i>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Fret not thyself because of evil <i>men</i>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>For there shall be no reward to the evil <i>man</i>; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <i>and</i> meddle not with them that are given to change:</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise. <i>It is</i> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <i>art</i> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>But to them that rebuke <i>him</i> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup><i>Every man</i> shall kiss <i>his</i> lips that giveth a right answer.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive <i>not</i> with thy lips.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <i>and</i> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Then I saw, <i>and</i> considered <i>it</i> well: I looked upon <i>it, and</i> received instruction.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup><i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>So shall thy poverty come <i>as</i> one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>These <i>are</i> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup><i>It is</i> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <i>is</i> to search out a matter.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <i>men</i>:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For better <i>it is</i> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <i>himself</i>; and discover not a secret to another:</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>A word fitly spoken <i>is like</i> apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup><i>As</i> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <i>so is</i> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <i>so is</i> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <i>is like</i> clouds and wind without rain.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house; lest he be weary of thee, and <i>so</i> hate thee.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <i>is</i> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <i>is like</i> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup><i>As</i> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <i>and as</i> vinegar upon nitre, so <i>is</i> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The north wind driveth away rain: so <i>doth</i> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup><i>It is</i> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup><i>As</i> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so <i>is</i> good news from a far country.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup><i>It is</i> not good to eat much honey: so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>He that <i>hath</i> no rule over his own spirit <i>is like</i> a city <i>that is</i> broken down, <i>and</i> without walls.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <i>and</i> drinketh damage.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The legs of the lame are not equal: so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so <i>is</i> he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup><i>As</i> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so <i>is</i> a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The great <i>God</i> that formed all <i>things</i> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>As a dog returneth to his vomit, <i>so</i> a fool returneth to his folly.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The slothful <i>man</i> saith, <i>There is</i> a lion in the way; a lion <i>is</i> in the streets.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup><i>As</i> the door turneth upon his hinges, so <i>doth</i> the slothful upon his bed.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The slothful hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The sluggard <i>is</i> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He that passeth by, <i>and</i> meddleth with strife <i>belonging</i> not to him, <i>is like</i> one that taketh a dog by the ears.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>As a mad <i>man</i> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>So <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Where no wood is, <i>there</i> the fire goeth out: so where <i>there is</i> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup><i>As</i> coals <i>are</i> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <i>is</i> a contentious man to kindle strife.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Burning lips and a wicked heart <i>are like</i> a potsherd covered with silver dross.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for <i>there are</i> seven abominations in his heart.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup><i>Whose</i> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the <i>whole</i> congregation.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>A lying tongue hateth <i>those that are</i> afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>A stone <i>is</i> heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath <i>is</i> heavier than them both.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Wrath <i>is</i> cruel, and anger <i>is</i> outrageous; but who <i>is</i> able to stand before envy?</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Open rebuke <i>is</i> better than secret love.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Faithful <i>are</i> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy <i>are</i> deceitful.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so <i>is</i> a man that wandereth from his place.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so <i>doth</i> the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: <i>for</i> better <i>is</i> a neighbour <i>that is</i> near than a brother far off.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil, <i>and</i> hideth himself; <i>but</i> the simple pass on, <i>and</i> are punished.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, <i>which</i> bewrayeth <i>itself</i>.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>As in water face <i>answereth</i> to face, so the heart of man to man.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup><i>As</i> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so <i>is</i> a man to his praise.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <i>yet</i> will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <i>and</i> look well to thy herds.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>For riches <i>are</i> not for ever: and doth the crown <i>endure</i> to every generation?</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>The lambs <i>are</i> for thy clothing, and the goats <i>are</i> the price of the field.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For the transgression of a land many <i>are</i> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <i>and</i> knowledge the state <i>thereof</i> shall be prolonged.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>A poor man that oppresseth the poor <i>is like</i> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all <i>things</i>.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Better <i>is</i> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways, though he <i>be</i> rich.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Whoso keepeth the law <i>is</i> a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous <i>men</i> shameth his father.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <i>shall be</i> abomination.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good <i>things</i> in possession.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The rich man <i>is</i> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>When righteous <i>men</i> do rejoice, <i>there is</i> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh <i>them</i> shall have mercy.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Happy <i>is</i> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup><i>As</i> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <i>so is</i> a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The prince that wanteth understanding <i>is</i> also a great oppressor: <i>but</i> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <i>his</i> days.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>A man that doeth violence to the blood of <i>any</i> person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain <i>persons</i> shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>To have respect of persons <i>is</i> not good: for for a piece of bread <i>that</i> man will transgress.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>He that hasteth to be rich <i>hath</i> an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <i>It is</i> no transgression; the same <i>is</i> the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his</i> neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth <i>his</i> substance.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>In the transgression of an evil man <i>there is</i> a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: <i>but</i> the wicked regardeth not to know <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <i>men</i> turn away wrath.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup><i>If</i> a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, <i>there is</i> no rest.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise <i>man</i> keepeth it in till afterwards.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants <i>are</i> wicked.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left <i>to himself</i> bringeth his mother to shame.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Where <i>there is</i> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Seest thou a man <i>that is</i> hasty in his words? <i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become <i>his</i> son at the length.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth <i>it</i> not.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Many seek the ruler’s favour; but <i>every</i> man’s judgment <i>cometh</i> from the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <i>even</i> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Surely I <i>am</i> more brutish than <i>any</i> man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <i>is</i> his name, and what <i>is</i> his son’s name, if thou canst tell?</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Every word of God <i>is</i> pure: he <i>is</i> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Two <i>things</i> have I required of thee; deny me <i>them</i> not before I die:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Lest I be full, and deny <i>thee</i>, and say, Who <i>is</i> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <i>in vain</i>.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup><i>There is</i> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup><i>There is</i> a generation, whose teeth <i>are as</i> swords, and their jaw teeth <i>as</i> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <i>among</i> men.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The horseleach hath two daughters, <i>crying</i>, Give, give. There are three <i>things that</i> are never satisfied, <i>yea</i>, four <i>things</i> say not, <i>It is</i> enough:</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <i>that</i> is not filled with water; and the fire <i>that</i> saith not, <i>It is</i> enough.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The eye <i>that</i> mocketh at <i>his</i> father, and despiseth to obey <i>his</i> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>There be three <i>things which</i> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Such <i>is</i> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>For three <i>things</i> the earth is disquieted, and for four <i>which</i> it cannot bear:</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>For an odious <i>woman</i> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>There be four <i>things which are</i> little upon the earth, but they <i>are</i> exceeding wise:</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The ants <i>are</i> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>There be three <i>things</i> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>A lion <i>which is</i> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup>Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <i>is</i> far above rubies.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>She perceiveth that her merchandise <i>is</i> good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <i>are</i> clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <i>is</i> silk and purple.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>She maketh fine linen, and selleth <i>it</i>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Strength and honour <i>are</i> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <i>is</i> the law of kindness.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <i>also</i>, and he praiseth her.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Favour <i>is</i> deceitful, and beauty <i>is</i> vain: <i>but</i> a woman <i>that</i> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
