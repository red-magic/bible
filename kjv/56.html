<h2>Titus</h2>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>To Titus, <i>mine</i> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>One of themselves, <i>even</i> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <i>are</i> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Unto the pure all things <i>are</i> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <i>is</i> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <i>him</i>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The aged women likewise, that <i>they be</i> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup><i>To be</i> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <i>shewing</i> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup><i>Exhort</i> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <i>and</i> to please <i>them</i> well in all <i>things</i>; not answering again;</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i>but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup><i>This is</i> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</p>
