<h2>Micah</h2>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <i>and</i> as the waters <i>that are</i> poured down a steep place.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For the transgression of Jacob <i>is</i> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <i>is</i> the transgression of Jacob? <i>is it</i> not Samaria? and what <i>are</i> the high places of Judah? <i>are they</i> not Jerusalem?</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <i>and</i> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <i>it</i> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For her wound <i>is</i> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <i>even</i> to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Declare ye <i>it</i> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <i>is</i> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <i>shall be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And they covet fields, and take <i>them</i> by violence; and houses, and take <i>them</i> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <i>is</i> evil.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>In that day shall <i>one</i> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <i>and</i> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <i>it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Prophesy ye not, <i>say they to them that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i>that</i> they shall not take shame.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>O <i>thou that art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <i>are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Arise ye, and depart; for this <i>is</i> not <i>your</i> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <i>you</i>, even with a sore destruction.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <i>saying</i>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <i>the multitude of</i> men.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <i>Is it</i> not for you to know judgment?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore night <i>shall be</i> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <i>there is</i> no answer of God.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, <i>Is</i> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <i>as</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>But in the last days it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <i>is there</i> no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <i>even</i> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <i>though</i> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <i>yet</i> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <i>that is</i> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <i>have been</i> from of old, from everlasting.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Therefore will he give them up, until the time <i>that</i> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And this <i>man</i> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <i>us</i> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no <i>more</i> soothsayers:</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD’S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <i>and</i> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <i>or</i> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <i>for</i> my transgression, the fruit of my body <i>for</i> the sin of my soul?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He hath shewed thee, O man, what <i>is</i> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The LORD’S voice crieth unto the city, and <i>the man of</i> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <i>that is</i> abominable?</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Shall I count <i>them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <i>is</i> deceitful in their mouth.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Therefore also will I make <i>thee</i> sick in smiting thee, in making <i>thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <i>shall be</i> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <i>that</i> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <i>there is</i> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The good <i>man</i> is perished out of the earth: and <i>there is</i> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <i>asketh</i> for a reward; and the great <i>man</i>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The best of them <i>is</i> as a brier: the most upright <i>is sharper</i> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <i>and</i> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man’s enemies <i>are</i> the men of his own house.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD <i>shall be</i> a light unto me.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <i>and</i> I shall behold his righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Then <i>she that is</i> mine enemy shall see <i>it</i>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup><i>In</i> the day that thy walls are to be built, <i>in</i> that day shall the decree be far removed.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup><i>In</i> that day <i>also</i> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and <i>from</i> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and <i>from</i> mountain to mountain.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily <i>in</i> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed <i>in</i> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous <i>things</i>.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay <i>their</i> hand upon <i>their</i> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Who <i>is</i> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth <i>in</i> mercy.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <i>and</i> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</p>
