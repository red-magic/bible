<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>But his delight <i>is</i> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The ungodly <i>are</i> not so: but <i>are</i> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Ask of me, and I shall give <i>thee</i> the heathen <i>for</i> thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth <i>for</i> thy possession.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish <i>from</i> the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed <i>are</i> all they that put their trust in him.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many <i>are</i> they that rise up against me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Many <i>there be</i> which say of my soul, <i>There is</i> no help for him in God. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But thou, O LORD, <i>art</i> a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <i>themselves</i> against me round about.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <i>upon</i> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Salvation <i>belongeth</i> unto the LORD: thy blessing <i>is</i> upon thy people. Selah.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <i>when I was</i> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>O ye sons of men, how long <i>will ye turn</i> my glory into shame? <i>how long</i> will ye love vanity, <i>and</i> seek after leasing? Selah.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup><i>There be</i> many that say, Who will shew us <i>any</i> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time <i>that</i> their corn and their wine increased.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct <i>my prayer</i> unto thee, and will look up.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For thou <i>art</i> not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>But as for me, I will come <i>into</i> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: <i>and</i> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For <i>there is</i> no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part <i>is</i> very wickedness; their throat <i>is</i> an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as <i>with</i> a shield.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I <i>am</i> weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For in death <i>there is</i> no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return <i>and</i> be ashamed suddenly.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <i>it</i> in pieces, while <i>there is</i> none to deliver.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <i>it</i>; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <i>to</i> the judgment <i>that</i> thou hast commanded.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <i>that is</i> in me.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>My defence <i>is</i> of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry <i>with the wicked</i> every day.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch <i>which</i> he made.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p>

<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. O LORD our Lord, how excellent <i>is</i> thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all <i>things</i> under his feet:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, <i>and whatsoever</i> passeth through the paths of the seas.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>O LORD our Lord, how excellent <i>is</i> thy name in all the earth!</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 9</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise <i>thee</i>, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <i>which I suffer</i> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The heathen are sunk down in the pit <i>that</i> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The LORD is known <i>by</i> the judgment <i>which</i> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The wicked shall be turned into hell, <i>and</i> all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall <i>not</i> perish for ever.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Put them in fear, O LORD: <i>that</i> the nations may know themselves <i>to be but</i> men. Selah.</p>

<section>
<h3>Psalm 10</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? <i>why</i> hidest thou <i>thyself</i> in times of trouble?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The wicked in <i>his</i> pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, <i>whom</i> the LORD abhorreth.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <i>after God</i>: God <i>is</i> not in all his thoughts.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <i>are</i> far above out of his sight: <i>as for</i> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <i>I shall</i> never <i>be</i> in adversity.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue <i>is</i> mischief and vanity.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He croucheth, <i>and</i> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thou hast seen <i>it</i>; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite <i>it</i> with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil <i>man</i>: seek out his wickedness <i>till</i> thou find none.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The LORD <i>is</i> King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p>
</section>

<h3>Psalm 11</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee <i>as</i> a bird to your mountain?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For, lo, the wicked bend <i>their</i> bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The LORD <i>is</i> in his holy temple, the LORD’S throne <i>is</i> in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <i>this shall be</i> the portion of their cup.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 12</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: <i>with</i> flattering lips <i>and</i> with a double heart do they speak.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, <i>and</i> the tongue that speaketh proud things:</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips <i>are</i> our own: who <i>is</i> lord over us?</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set <i>him</i> in safety <i>from him that</i> puffeth at him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The words of the LORD <i>are</i> pure words: <i>as</i> silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 13</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>How long shall I take counsel in my soul, <i>having</i> sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Consider <i>and</i> hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the <i>sleep of</i> death;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; <i>and</i> those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 14</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David. The fool hath said in his heart, <i>There is</i> no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, <i>there is</i> none that doeth good.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, <i>and</i> seek God.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>They are all gone aside, they are <i>all</i> together become filthy: <i>there is</i> none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <i>as</i> they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>There were they in great fear: for God <i>is</i> in the generation of the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD <i>is</i> his refuge.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Oh that the salvation of Israel <i>were come</i> out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <i>and</i> Israel shall be glad.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 15</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><i>He that</i> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <i>He that</i> sweareth to <i>his own</i> hurt, and changeth not.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup><i>He that</i> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <i>things</i> shall never be moved.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 16</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup><i>O my soul</i>, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou <i>art</i> my Lord: my goodness <i>extendeth</i> not to thee;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><i>But</i> to the saints that <i>are</i> in the earth, and <i>to</i> the excellent, in whom <i>is</i> all my delight.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Their sorrows shall be multiplied <i>that</i> hasten <i>after</i> another <i>god</i>: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The LORD <i>is</i> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant <i>places</i>; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I have set the LORD always before me: because <i>he is</i> at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence <i>is</i> fulness of joy; at thy right hand <i>there are</i> pleasures for evermore.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, <i>that goeth</i> not out of feigned lips.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited <i>me</i> in the night; thou hast tried me, <i>and</i> shalt find nothing; I am purposed <i>that</i> my mouth shall not transgress.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept <i>me from</i> the paths of the destroyer.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Hold up my goings in thy paths, <i>that</i> my footsteps slip not.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, <i>and hear</i> my speech.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust <i>in thee</i> from those that rise up <i>against them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>From the wicked that oppress me, <i>from</i> my deadly enemies, <i>who</i> compass me about.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Like as a lion <i>that</i> is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, <i>which is</i> thy sword:</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>From men <i>which are</i> thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, <i>which have</i> their portion in <i>this</i> life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid <i>treasure</i>: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their <i>substance</i> to their babes.</p>

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <i>that</i> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <i>and</i> my high tower.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I will call upon the LORD, <i>who is worthy</i> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <i>even</i> into his ears.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <i>were</i> dark waters <i>and</i> thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>At the brightness <i>that was</i> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For all his judgments <i>were</i> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup><i>As for</i> God, his way <i>is</i> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he <i>is</i> a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>For who <i>is</i> God save the LORD? or who <i>is</i> a rock save our God?</p>
<p><sup>32</sup><i>It is</i> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>He maketh my feet like hinds’ <i>feet</i>, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>They cried, but <i>there was</i> none to save <i>them: even</i> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <i>and</i> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <i>whom</i> I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p><sup>45</sup>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>The LORD liveth; and blessed <i>be</i> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p><sup>47</sup><i>It is</i> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p><sup>48</sup>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p><sup>49</sup>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p><sup>50</sup>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>

<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><i>There is</i> no speech nor language, <i>where</i> their voice is not heard.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Which <i>is</i> as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, <i>and</i> rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>His going forth <i>is</i> from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The law of the LORD <i>is</i> perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD <i>is</i> sure, making wise the simple.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The statutes of the LORD <i>are</i> right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD <i>is</i> pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD <i>are</i> true <i>and</i> righteous altogether.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>More to be desired <i>are they</i> than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Moreover by them is thy servant warned: <i>and</i> in keeping of them <i>there is</i> great reward.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Who can understand <i>his</i> errors? cleanse thou me from secret <i>faults</i>.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous <i>sins</i>; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>His glory <i>is</i> great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p>

<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <i>why art thou so</i> far from helping me, <i>and from</i> the words of my roaring?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But thou <i>art</i> holy, <i>O thou</i> that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>But I <i>am</i> a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He trusted on the LORD <i>that</i> he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>But thou <i>art</i> he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope <i>when I was</i> upon my mother’s breasts.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou <i>art</i> my God from my mother’s belly.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Be not far from me; for trouble <i>is</i> near; for <i>there is</i> none to help.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Many bulls have compassed me: strong <i>bulls</i> of Bashan have beset me round.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>They gaped upon me <i>with</i> their mouths, <i>as</i> a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I may tell all my bones: they look <i>and</i> stare upon me.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>My praise <i>shall be</i> of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>For the kingdom <i>is</i> the LORD’S: and he <i>is</i> the governor among the nations.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>All <i>they that be</i> fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done <i>this</i>.</p>

<h3>Psalm 27</h3>

<p><sup>2</sup>When the wicked, <i>even</i> mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> confident.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>One <i>thing</i> have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Hear, O LORD, <i>when</i> I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup><i>When thou saidst</i>, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Hide not thy face <i>far</i> from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup><i>I had fainted</i>, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>The voice of the LORD <i>is</i> powerful; the voice of the LORD <i>is</i> full of majesty.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>For thou <i>art</i> my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou <i>art</i> my strength.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <i>yea</i>, my soul and my belly.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>For I have heard the slander of many: fear <i>was</i> on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <i>art</i> my God.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My times <i>are</i> in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, <i>and</i> let them be silent in the grave.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup><i>Oh</i> how great <i>is</i> thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; <i>which</i> thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>O love the LORD, all ye his saints: <i>for</i> the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</p>

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup><i>A Psalm</i> of David, Maschil. Blessed <i>is he whose</i> transgression <i>is</i> forgiven, <i>whose</i> sin <i>is</i> covered.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit <i>there is</i> no guile.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Be ye not as the horse, <i>or</i> as the mule, <i>which</i> have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Many sorrows <i>shall be</i> to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <i>ye that are</i> upright in heart.</p>

<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: <i>for</i> praise is comely for the upright.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery <i>and</i> an instrument of ten strings.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For the word of the LORD <i>is</i> right; and all his works <i>are done</i> in truth.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For he spake, and it was <i>done</i>; he commanded, and it stood fast.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the nation whose God <i>is</i> the LORD; <i>and</i> the people <i>whom</i> he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>An horse <i>is</i> a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver <i>any</i> by his great strength.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Behold, the eye of the LORD <i>is</i> upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he <i>is</i> our help and our shield.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.</p>

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup><i>A Psalm</i> of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise <i>shall</i> continually <i>be</i> in my mouth.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear <i>thereof</i>, and be glad.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>This poor man cried, and the LORD heard <i>him</i>, and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>O taste and see that the LORD <i>is</i> good: blessed <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> trusteth in him.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for <i>there is</i> no want to them that fear him.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good <i>thing</i>.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>What man <i>is he that</i> desireth life, <i>and</i> loveth <i>many</i> days, that he may see good?</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> upon the righteous, and his ears <i>are open</i> unto their cry.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The face of the LORD <i>is</i> against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup><i>The righteous</i> cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The LORD <i>is</i> nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Many <i>are</i> the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.</p>

<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup><i>A Psalm</i> of David. Plead <i>my cause</i>, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Draw out also the spear, and stop <i>the way</i> against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <i>am</i> thy salvation.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For without cause have they hid for me their net <i>in</i> a pit, <i>which</i> without cause they have digged for my soul.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>All my bones shall say, LORD, who <i>is</i> like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <i>things</i> that I knew not.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>They rewarded me evil for good <i>to</i> the spoiling of my soul.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <i>was</i> sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>I behaved myself as though <i>he had been</i> my friend <i>or</i> brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <i>for his</i> mother.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: <i>yea</i>, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew <i>it</i> not; they did tear <i>me</i>, and ceased not:</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: <i>neither</i> let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against <i>them that are</i> quiet in the land.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, <i>and</i> said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup><i>This</i> thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, <i>even</i> unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness <i>and</i> of thy praise all the day long.</p>

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, <i>that there is</i> no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The words of his mouth <i>are</i> iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, <i>and</i> to do good.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way <i>that is</i> not good; he abhorreth not evil.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thy mercy, O LORD, <i>is</i> in the heavens; <i>and</i> thy faithfulness <i>reacheth</i> unto the clouds.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thy righteousness <i>is</i> like the great mountains; thy judgments <i>are</i> a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>How excellent <i>is</i> thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For with thee <i>is</i> the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.</p>

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup><i>A Psalm</i> of David. Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Trust in the LORD, and do good; <i>so</i> shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring <i>it</i> to pass.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For yet a little while, and the wicked <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, <i>and</i> to slay such as be of upright conversation.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>A little that a righteous man hath <i>is</i> better than the riches of many wicked.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD <i>shall be</i> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For <i>such as be</i> blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and <i>they that be</i> cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The steps of a <i>good</i> man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth <i>him with</i> his hand.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>I have been young, and <i>now</i> am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup><i>He is</i> ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed <i>is</i> blessed.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>The law of his God <i>is</i> in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he <i>was</i> not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>Mark the perfect <i>man</i>, and behold the upright: for the end of <i>that</i> man <i>is</i> peace.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>But the salvation of the righteous <i>is</i> of the LORD: <i>he is</i> their strength in the time of trouble.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</p>

<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><i>There is</i> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <i>is there any</i> rest in my bones because of my sin.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>My wounds stink <i>and</i> are corrupt because of my foolishness.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For my loins are filled with a loathsome <i>disease</i>: and <i>there is</i> no soundness in my flesh.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Lord, all my desire <i>is</i> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>They also that seek after my life lay snares <i>for me</i>: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>But I, as a deaf <i>man</i>, heard not; and <i>I was</i> as a dumb man <i>that</i> openeth not his mouth.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth <i>are</i> no reproofs.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For I said, <i>Hear me</i>, lest <i>otherwise</i> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>For I <i>am</i> ready to halt, and my sorrow <i>is</i> continually before me.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>But mine enemies <i>are</i> lively, <i>and</i> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow <i>the thing that</i> good <i>is</i>.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</p>

<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, <i>even</i> to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, <i>even</i> from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: <i>then</i> spake I with my tongue,</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it <i>is; that</i> I may know how frail I <i>am</i>.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Behold, thou hast made my days <i>as</i> an handbreadth; and mine age <i>is</i> as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state <i>is</i> altogether vanity. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up <i>riches</i>, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope <i>is</i> in thee.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man <i>is</i> vanity. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I <i>am</i> a stranger with thee, <i>and</i> a sojourner, as all my fathers <i>were</i>.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</p>

<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, <i>and</i> established my goings.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And he hath put a new song in my mouth, <i>even</i> praise unto our God: many shall see <i>it</i>, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Many, O LORD my God, <i>are</i> thy wonderful works <i>which</i> thou hast done, and thy thoughts <i>which are</i> to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: <i>if</i> I would declare and speak <i>of them</i>, they are more than can be numbered.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book <i>it is</i> written of me,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law <i>is</i> within my heart.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>But I <i>am</i> poor and needy; <i>yet</i> the Lord thinketh upon me: thou <i>art</i> my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>And if he come to see <i>me</i>, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; <i>when</i> he goeth abroad, he telleth <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>An evil disease, <i>say they</i>, cleaveth fast unto him: and <i>now</i> that he lieth he shall rise up no more.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up <i>his</i> heel against me.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.</p>

<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where <i>is</i> thy God?</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>When I remember these <i>things</i>, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and <i>why</i> art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him <i>for</i> the help of his countenance.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup><i>Yet</i> the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song <i>shall be</i> with me, <i>and</i> my prayer unto the God of my life.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>
<p><sup>10</sup><i>As</i> with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where <i>is</i> thy God?</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, <i>who is</i> the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.</p>

<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, <i>what</i> work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup><i>How</i> thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; <i>how</i> thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Thou hast given us like sheep <i>appointed</i> for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase <i>thy wealth</i> by their price.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My confusion <i>is</i> continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast <i>us</i> not off for ever.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, <i>and</i> forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.</p>

<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue <i>is</i> the pen of a ready writer.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Gird thy sword upon <i>thy</i> thigh, O <i>most</i> mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness <i>and</i> righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thine arrows <i>are</i> sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; <i>whereby</i> the people fall under thee.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thy throne, O God, <i>is</i> for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom <i>is</i> a right sceptre.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>All thy garments <i>smell</i> of myrrh, and aloes, <i>and</i> cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Kings’ daughters <i>were</i> among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he <i>is</i> thy Lord; and worship thou him.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And the daughter of Tyre <i>shall be there</i> with a gift; <i>even</i> the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The king’s daughter <i>is</i> all glorious within: her clothing <i>is</i> of wrought gold.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</p>

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth. God <i>is</i> our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><i>Though</i> the waters thereof roar <i>and</i> be troubled, <i>though</i> the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup><i>There is</i> a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy <i>place</i> of the tabernacles of the most High.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>God <i>is</i> in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, <i>and that</i> right early.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> with us; the God of Jacob <i>is</i> our refuge. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Be still, and know that I <i>am</i> God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> with us; the God of Jacob <i>is</i> our refuge. Selah.</p>

<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Song <i>and</i> Psalm for the sons of Korah. Great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, <i>in</i> the mountain of his holiness.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, <i>is</i> mount Zion, <i>on</i> the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They saw <i>it, and</i> so they marvelled; they were troubled, <i>and</i> hasted away.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Fear took hold upon them there, <i>and</i> pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>According to thy name, O God, so <i>is</i> thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell <i>it</i> to the generation following.</p>

<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all <i>ye</i> people; give ear, all <i>ye</i> inhabitants of the world:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart <i>shall be</i> of understanding.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <i>when</i> the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>None <i>of them</i> can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>(For the redemption of their soul <i>is</i> precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>That he should still live for ever, <i>and</i> not see corruption.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For he seeth <i>that</i> wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Their inward thought <i>is, that</i> their houses <i>shall continue</i> for ever, <i>and</i> their dwelling places to all generations; they call <i>their</i> lands after their own names.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Nevertheless man <i>being</i> in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts <i>that</i> perish.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>This their way <i>is</i> their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and <i>men</i> will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Man <i>that is</i> in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts <i>that</i> perish.</p>

<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Psalm of Asaph. The mighty God, <i>even</i> the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God <i>is</i> judge himself. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I <i>am</i> God, <i>even</i> thy God.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, <i>to have been</i> continually before me.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I will take no bullock out of thy house, <i>nor</i> he goats out of thy folds.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For every beast of the forest <i>is</i> mine, <i>and</i> the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field <i>are</i> mine.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world <i>is</i> mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or <i>that</i> thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Thou sittest <i>and</i> speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>These <i>things</i> hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether <i>such an one</i> as thyself: <i>but</i> I will reprove thee, and set <i>them</i> in order before thine eyes.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear <i>you</i> in pieces, and <i>there be</i> none to deliver.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth <i>his</i> conversation <i>aright</i> will I shew the salvation of God.</p>

<h3>Psalm 51</h3>

<p><sup>2</sup>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <i>is</i> ever before me.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <i>this</i> evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, <i>and</i> be clear when thou judgest.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden <i>part</i> thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Make me to hear joy and gladness; <i>that</i> the bones <i>which</i> thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me <i>with thy</i> free spirit.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup><i>Then</i> will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: <i>and</i> my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give <i>it</i>: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The sacrifices of God <i>are</i> a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Thou lovest evil more than good; <i>and</i> lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>Lo, <i>this is</i> the man <i>that</i> made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, <i>and</i> strengthened himself in his wickedness.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But I <i>am</i> like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! <i>for then</i> would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Lo, <i>then</i> would I wander far off, <i>and</i> remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I would hasten my escape from the windy storm <i>and</i> tempest.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Destroy, O Lord, <i>and</i> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <i>are</i> in the midst of it.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Wickedness <i>is</i> in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For <i>it was</i> not an enemy <i>that</i> reproached me; then I could have borne <i>it</i>: neither <i>was it</i> he that hated me <i>that</i> did magnify <i>himself</i> against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>But <i>it was</i> thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>We took sweet counsel together, <i>and</i> walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Let death seize upon them, <i>and</i> let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness <i>is</i> in their dwellings, <i>and</i> among them.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle <i>that was</i> against me: for there were many with me.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup><i>The words</i> of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <i>was</i> in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet <i>were</i> they drawn swords.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Mine enemies would daily swallow <i>me</i> up: for <i>they be</i> many that fight against me, O thou most High.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts <i>are</i> against me for evil.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Shall they escape by iniquity? in <i>thine</i> anger cast down the people, O God.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: <i>are they</i> not in thy book?</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>When I cry <i>unto thee</i>, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God <i>is</i> for me.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>In God will I praise <i>his</i> word: in the LORD will I praise <i>his</i> word.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Thy vows <i>are</i> upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>For thou hast delivered my soul from death: <i>wilt</i> not <i>thou deliver</i> my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</p>

<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until <i>these</i> calamities be overpast.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth <i>all things</i> for me.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>He shall send from heaven, and save me <i>from</i> the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>My soul <i>is</i> among lions: <i>and</i> I lie <i>even among</i> them that are set on fire, <i>even</i> the sons of men, whose teeth <i>are</i> spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; <i>let</i> thy glory <i>be</i> above all the earth.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen <i>themselves</i>. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I <i>myself</i> will awake early.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For thy mercy <i>is</i> great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: <i>let</i> thy glory <i>be</i> above all the earth.</p>

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Their poison <i>is</i> like the poison of a serpent: <i>they are</i> like the deaf adder <i>that</i> stoppeth her ear;</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Let them melt away as waters <i>which</i> run continually: <i>when</i> he bendeth <i>his bow to shoot</i> his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>As a snail <i>which</i> melteth, let <i>every one of them</i> pass away: <i>like</i> the untimely birth of a woman, <i>that</i> they may not see the sun.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in <i>his</i> wrath.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>So that a man shall say, Verily <i>there is</i> a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</p>

<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not <i>for</i> my transgression, nor <i>for</i> my sin, O LORD.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>They run and prepare themselves without <i>my</i> fault: awake to help me, and behold.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords <i>are</i> in their lips: for who, <i>say they</i>, doth hear?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup><i>Because of</i> his strength will I wait upon thee: for God <i>is</i> my defence.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see <i>my desire</i> upon mine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup><i>For</i> the sin of their mouth <i>and</i> the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying <i>which</i> they speak.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Consume <i>them</i> in wrath, consume <i>them</i>, that they <i>may</i> not <i>be</i>: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And at evening let them return; <i>and</i> let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God <i>is</i> my defence, <i>and</i> the God of my mercy.</p>

<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with Aramzobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>That thy beloved may be delivered; save <i>with</i> thy right hand, and hear me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Gilead <i>is</i> mine, and Manasseh <i>is</i> mine; Ephraim also <i>is</i> the strength of mine head; Judah <i>is</i> my lawgiver;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Moab <i>is</i> my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Who will bring me <i>into</i> the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p><sup>10</sup><i>Wilt</i> not thou, O God, <i>which</i> hadst cast us off? and <i>thou</i>, O God, <i>which</i> didst not go out with our armies?</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Give us help from trouble: for vain <i>is</i> the help of man.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Through God we shall do valiantly: for he <i>it is that</i> shall tread down our enemies.</p>

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Neginah, <i>A Psalm</i> of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock <i>that</i> is higher than I.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For thou hast been a shelter for me, <i>and</i> a strong tower from the enemy.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given <i>me</i> the heritage of those that fear thy name.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: <i>and</i> his years as many generations.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, <i>which</i> may preserve him.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.</p>

<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him <i>cometh</i> my salvation.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>He only <i>is</i> my rock and my salvation; <i>he is</i> my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall <i>shall ye be, and as</i> a tottering fence.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>They only consult to cast <i>him</i> down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation <i>is</i> from him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>He only <i>is</i> my rock and my salvation: <i>he is</i> my defence; I shall not be moved.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>In God <i>is</i> my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, <i>and</i> my refuge, <i>is</i> in God.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God <i>is</i> a refuge for us. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Surely men of low degree <i>are</i> vanity, <i>and</i> men of high degree <i>are</i> a lie: to be laid in the balance, they <i>are</i> altogether <i>lighter</i> than vanity.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart <i>upon them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power <i>belongeth</i> unto God.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Also unto thee, O Lord, <i>belongeth</i> mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</p>

<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou <i>art</i> my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>To see thy power and thy glory, so <i>as</i> I have seen thee in the sanctuary.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Because thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>My soul shall be satisfied as <i>with</i> marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise <i>thee</i> with joyful lips:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>When I remember thee upon my bed, <i>and</i> meditate on thee in the <i>night</i> watches.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>But those <i>that</i> seek my soul, to destroy <i>it</i>, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</p>

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Who whet their tongue like a sword, <i>and</i> bend <i>their bows to shoot</i> their arrows, <i>even</i> bitter words:</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They encourage themselves <i>in</i> an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward <i>thought</i> of every one <i>of them</i>, and the heart, <i>is</i> deep.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>But God shall shoot at them <i>with</i> an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>

<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm <i>and</i> Song of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Iniquities prevail against me: <i>as for</i> our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Blessed <i>is the man whom</i> thou choosest, and causest to approach <i>unto thee, that</i> he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, <i>even</i> of thy holy temple.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup><i>By</i> terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; <i>who art</i> the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off <i>upon</i> the sea:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; <i>being</i> girded with power:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, <i>which</i> is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>They drop <i>upon</i> the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.</p>

<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Song <i>or</i> Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Say unto God, How terrible <i>art thou in</i> thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing <i>to</i> thy name. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Come and see the works of God: <i>he is</i> terrible <i>in his</i> doing toward the children of men.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>He turned the sea into dry <i>land</i>: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy <i>place</i>.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Come <i>and</i> hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear <i>me</i>:</p>
<p><sup>19</sup><i>But</i> verily God hath heard <i>me</i>; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p>

<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm <i>or</i> Song of David. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>As smoke is driven away, <i>so</i> drive <i>them</i> away: as wax melteth before the fire, <i>so</i> let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, <i>is</i> God in his holy habitation.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry <i>land</i>.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: <i>even</i> Sinai itself <i>was moved</i> at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The Lord gave the word: great <i>was</i> the company of those that published <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Though ye have lien among the pots, <i>yet shall ye be as</i> the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was <i>white</i> as snow in Salmon.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The hill of God <i>is as</i> the hill of Bashan; an high hill <i>as</i> the hill of Bashan.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Why leap ye, ye high hills? <i>this is</i> the hill <i>which</i> God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell <i>in it</i> for ever.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The chariots of God <i>are</i> twenty thousand, <i>even</i> thousands of angels: the Lord <i>is</i> among them, <i>as in</i> Sinai, in the holy <i>place</i>.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, <i>for</i> the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell <i>among them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord, <i>who</i> daily loadeth us <i>with benefits, even</i> the God of our salvation. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup><i>He that is</i> our God <i>is</i> the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord <i>belong</i> the issues from death.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>But God shall wound the head of his enemies, <i>and</i> the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring <i>my people</i> again from the depths of the sea:</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of <i>thine</i> enemies, <i>and</i> the tongue of thy dogs in the same.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>They have seen thy goings, O God; <i>even</i> the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The singers went before, the players on instruments <i>followed</i> after; among <i>them were</i> the damsels playing with timbrels.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Bless ye God in the congregations, <i>even</i> the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>There <i>is</i> little Benjamin <i>with</i> their ruler, the princes of Judah <i>and</i> their council, the princes of Zebulun, <i>and</i> the princes of Naphtali.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, <i>till every one</i> submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people <i>that</i> delight in war.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, <i>which were</i> of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, <i>and that</i> a mighty voice.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency <i>is</i> over Israel, and his strength <i>is</i> in the clouds.</p>

<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, <i>A Psalm</i> of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <i>my</i> soul.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>I sink in deep mire, where <i>there is</i> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <i>being</i> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <i>that</i> which I took not away.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>When I wept, <i>and chastened</i> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <i>was</i> the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>But as for me, my prayer <i>is</i> unto thee, O LORD, <i>in</i> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Draw nigh unto my soul, <i>and</i> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <i>are</i> all before thee.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <i>for some</i> to take pity, but <i>there was</i> none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Let their table become a snare before them: and <i>that which should have been</i> for <i>their</i> welfare, <i>let it become</i> a trap.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Let their habitation be desolate; <i>and</i> let none dwell in their tents.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For they persecute <i>him</i> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>But I <i>am</i> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup><i>This</i> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <i>or</i> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>The humble shall see <i>this, and</i> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>

<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou <i>art</i> my rock and my fortress.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For thou <i>art</i> my hope, O Lord GOD: <i>thou art</i> my trust from my youth.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise <i>shall be</i> continually of thee.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>I am as a wonder unto many; but thou <i>art</i> my strong refuge.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Let my mouth be filled <i>with</i> thy praise <i>and with</i> thy honour all the day.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for <i>there is</i> none to deliver <i>him</i>.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Let them be confounded <i>and</i> consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered <i>with</i> reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness <i>and</i> thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers <i>thereof</i>.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, <i>even</i> of thine only.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto <i>this</i> generation, <i>and</i> thy power to every one <i>that</i> is to come.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Thy righteousness also, O God, <i>is</i> very high, who hast done great things: O God, who <i>is</i> like unto thee!</p>
<p><sup>20</sup><i>Thou</i>, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>I will also praise thee with the psaltery, <i>even</i> thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</p>

<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God <i>is</i> good to Israel, <i>even</i> to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For I was envious at the foolish, <i>when</i> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For <i>there are</i> no bands in their death: but their strength <i>is</i> firm.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They <i>are</i> not in trouble <i>as other</i> men; neither are they plagued like <i>other</i> men.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them <i>as</i> a garment.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>They are corrupt, and speak wickedly <i>concerning</i> oppression: they speak loftily.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full <i>cup</i> are wrung out to them.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Behold, these <i>are</i> the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase <i>in</i> riches.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Verily I have cleansed my heart <i>in</i> vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend <i>against</i> the generation of thy children.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>When I thought to know this, it <i>was</i> too painful for me;</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Until I went into the sanctuary of God; <i>then</i> understood I their end.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>How are they <i>brought</i> into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>As a dream when <i>one</i> awaketh; <i>so</i>, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>So foolish <i>was</i> I, and ignorant: I was <i>as</i> a beast before thee.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Nevertheless I <i>am</i> continually with thee: thou hast holden <i>me</i> by my right hand.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me <i>to</i> glory.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Whom have I in heaven <i>but thee</i>? and <i>there is</i> none upon earth <i>that</i> I desire beside thee.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>My flesh and my heart faileth: <i>but</i> God <i>is</i> the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>But <i>it is</i> good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</p>

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast <i>us</i> off for ever? <i>why</i> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Remember thy congregation, <i>which</i> thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, <i>which</i> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <i>even</i> all <i>that</i> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns <i>for</i> signs.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup><i>A man</i> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled <i>by casting down</i> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>We see not our signs: <i>there is</i> no more any prophet: neither <i>is there</i> among us any that knoweth how long.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck <i>it</i> out of thy bosom.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>For God <i>is</i> my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, <i>and</i> gavest him <i>to be</i> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The day <i>is</i> thine, the night also <i>is</i> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Remember this, <i>that</i> the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and <i>that</i> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude <i>of the wicked</i>: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup>For promotion <i>cometh</i> neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>But God <i>is</i> the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>For in the hand of the LORD <i>there is</i> a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring <i>them</i> out, <i>and</i> drink <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thou <i>art</i> more glorious <i>and</i> excellent than the mountains of prey.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou, <i>even</i> thou, <i>art</i> to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</p>

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried unto God with my voice, <i>even</i> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <i>his</i> promise fail for evermore?</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And I said, This <i>is</i> my infirmity: <i>but I will remember</i> the years of the right hand of the most High.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Thy way, O God, <i>is</i> in the sanctuary: who <i>is so</i> great a God as <i>our</i> God?</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Thou <i>art</i> the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Thou hast with <i>thine</i> arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The voice of thy thunder <i>was</i> in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Thy way <i>is</i> in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, <i>to</i> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>That the generation to come might know <i>them, even</i> the children <i>which</i> should be born; <i>who</i> should arise and declare <i>them</i> to their children:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i>that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Therefore the LORD heard <i>this</i>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths,</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>And they remembered that God <i>was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i>them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>For he remembered that they <i>were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>They remembered not his hand, <i>nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p><sup>45</sup>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p><sup>47</sup>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p><sup>48</sup>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p><sup>49</sup>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>50</sup>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p><sup>51</sup>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p><sup>52</sup>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p><sup>53</sup>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p><sup>54</sup>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain, <i>which</i> his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p><sup>55</sup>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p><sup>56</sup>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p><sup>57</sup>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p><sup>58</sup>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p><sup>59</sup>When God heard <i>this</i>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p><sup>60</sup>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i>which</i> he placed among men;</p>
<p><sup>61</sup>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p><sup>62</sup>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>63</sup>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p><sup>64</sup>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p><sup>65</sup>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p><sup>66</sup>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p><sup>67</sup>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p><sup>68</sup>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p><sup>69</sup>And he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces</i>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p><sup>70</sup>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p><sup>71</sup>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>72</sup>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <i>is</i> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight <i>by</i> the revenging of the blood of thy servants <i>which is</i> shed.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</p>

<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon ShoshannimEduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest <i>between</i> the cherubims, shine forth.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come <i>and</i> save us.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thou preparedst <i>room</i> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof <i>were like</i> the goodly cedars.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Why hast thou <i>then</i> broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch <i>that</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup><i>It is</i> burned with fire, <i>it is</i> cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man <i>whom</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician upon Gittith, <i>A Psalm</i> of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For this <i>was</i> a statute for Israel, <i>and</i> a law of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>This he ordained in Joseph <i>for</i> a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: <i>where</i> I heard a language <i>that</i> I understood not.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: <i>and</i> they walked in their own counsels.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <i>and</i> Israel had walked in my ways!</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <i>being</i> a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Do unto them as <i>unto</i> the Midianites; as <i>to</i> Sisera, as <i>to</i> Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>
<p><sup>10</sup><i>Which</i> perished at Endor: they became <i>as</i> dung for the earth.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>That <i>men</i> may know that thou, whose name alone <i>is</i> JEHOVAH, <i>art</i> the most high over all the earth.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man <i>that hath</i> no strength:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted <i>me</i> with all thy waves. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: <i>I am</i> shut up, and I cannot come forth.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise <i>and</i> praise thee? Selah.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? <i>or</i> thy faithfulness in destruction?</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>LORD, why castest thou off my soul? <i>why</i> hidest thou thy face from me?</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.</p>

<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? <i>who</i> among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all <i>them that are</i> about him.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>O LORD God of hosts, who <i>is</i> a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The heavens <i>are</i> thine, the earth also <i>is</i> thine: <i>as for</i> the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, <i>and</i> high is thy right hand.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Justice and judgment <i>are</i> the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>For thou <i>art</i> the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>For the LORD <i>is</i> our defence; and the Holy One of Israel <i>is</i> our king.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon <i>one that is</i> mighty; I have exalted <i>one</i> chosen out of the people.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>But my faithfulness and my mercy <i>shall be</i> with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He shall cry unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Also I will make him <i>my</i> firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>His seed also will I make <i>to endure</i> for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>It shall be established for ever as the moon, and <i>as</i> a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown <i>by casting it</i> to the ground.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
<p><sup>45</sup>The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</p>
<p><sup>47</sup>Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</p>
<p><sup>48</sup>What man <i>is he that</i> liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</p>
<p><sup>49</sup>Lord, where <i>are</i> thy former lovingkindnesses, <i>which</i> thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</p>
<p><sup>50</sup>Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; <i>how</i> I do bear in my bosom <i>the reproach of</i> all the mighty people;</p>
<p><sup>51</sup>Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</p>
<p><sup>52</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>For a thousand years in thy sight <i>are but</i> as yesterday when it is past, and <i>as</i> a watch in the night.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are <i>as</i> a sleep: in the morning <i>they are</i> like grass <i>which</i> groweth up.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>The days of our years <i>are</i> threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength <i>they be</i> fourscore years, yet <i>is</i> their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>So teach <i>us</i> to number our days, that we may apply <i>our</i> hearts unto wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Make us glad according to the days <i>wherein</i> thou hast afflicted us, <i>and</i> the years <i>wherein</i> we have seen evil.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>O LORD, how great are thy works! <i>and</i> thy thoughts are very deep.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; <i>it is</i> that they shall be destroyed for ever:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But thou, LORD, <i>art most</i> high for evermore.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>But my horn shalt thou exalt like <i>the horn of</i> an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Mine eye also shall see <i>my desire</i> on mine enemies, <i>and</i> mine ears shall hear <i>my desire</i> of the wicked that rise up against me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>To shew that the LORD <i>is</i> upright: <i>he is</i> my rock, and <i>there is</i> no unrighteousness in him.</p>

<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, <i>wherewith</i> he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Thy throne <i>is</i> established of old: thou <i>art</i> from everlasting.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The LORD on high <i>is</i> mightier than the noise of many waters, <i>yea, than</i> the mighty waves of the sea.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.</p>

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>
<p><sup>4</sup><i>How long</i> shall they utter <i>and</i> speak hard things? <i>and</i> all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Understand, ye brutish among the people: and <i>ye</i> fools, when will ye be wise?</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, <i>shall not he know</i>?</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they <i>are</i> vanity.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? <i>or</i> who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Unless the LORD <i>had been</i> my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>But the LORD is my defence; and my God <i>is</i> the rock of my refuge.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; <i>yea</i>, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</p>

<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Hide not thy face from me in the day <i>when</i> I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day <i>when</i> I call answer me speedily.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Mine enemies reproach me all the day; <i>and</i> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>My days <i>are</i> like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Thou shalt arise, <i>and</i> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years <i>are</i> throughout all generations.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens <i>are</i> the work of thy hands.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>But thou <i>art</i> the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p>

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup><i>A Psalm</i> of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, <i>bless</i> his holy name.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good <i>things; so that</i> thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The LORD <i>is</i> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He will not always chide: neither will he keep <i>his anger</i> for ever.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>For as the heaven is high above the earth, <i>so</i> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>As far as the east is from the west, <i>so</i> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Like as a father pitieth <i>his</i> children, <i>so</i> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we <i>are</i> dust.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup><i>As for</i> man, his days <i>are</i> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>But the mercy of the LORD <i>is</i> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Bless ye the LORD, all <i>ye</i> his hosts; <i>ye</i> ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>

<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Who coverest <i>thyself</i> with light as <i>with</i> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup><i>Who</i> laid the foundations of the earth, <i>that</i> it should not be removed for ever.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Thou coveredst it with the deep as <i>with</i> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <i>which</i> run among the hills.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <i>which</i> sing among the branches.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And wine <i>that</i> maketh glad the heart of man, <i>and</i> oil to make <i>his</i> face to shine, and bread <i>which</i> strengtheneth man’s heart.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>The trees of the LORD are full <i>of sap</i>; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Where the birds make their nests: <i>as for</i> the stork, the fir trees <i>are</i> her house.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The high hills <i>are</i> a refuge for the wild goats; <i>and</i> the rocks for the conies.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <i>forth</i>.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup><i>So is</i> this great and wide sea, wherein <i>are</i> things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>There go the ships: <i>there is</i> that leviathan, <i>whom</i> thou hast made to play therein.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give <i>them</i> their meat in due season.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup><i>That</i> thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>He <i>is</i> the LORD our God: his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Which <i>covenant</i> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>When they were <i>but</i> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>When they went from one nation to another, from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup><i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He sent a man before them, <i>even</i> Joseph, <i>who</i> was sold for a servant:</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>The king sent and loosed him; <i>even</i> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>He sent Moses his servant; <i>and</i> Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <i>and</i> lice in all their coasts.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>He gave them hail for rain, <i>and</i> flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <i>there was</i> not one feeble <i>person</i> among their tribes.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup><i>The people</i> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places <i>like</i> a river.</p>

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <i>who</i> can shew forth all his praise?</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Blessed <i>are</i> they that keep judgment, <i>and</i> he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <i>that thou bearest unto</i> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <i>him</i> at the sea, <i>even</i> at the Red sea.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <i>them</i>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>They envied Moses also in the camp, <i>and</i> Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <i>and</i> terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>But murmured in their tents, <i>and</i> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Thus they provoked <i>him</i> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <i>so</i> the plague was stayed.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>They angered <i>him</i> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>And shed innocent blood, <i>even</i> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <i>him</i> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p><sup>45</sup>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p><sup>47</sup>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <i>and</i> to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p><sup>48</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>O give thanks unto the LORD, for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Let the redeemed of the LORD say <i>so</i>, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, <i>being</i> bound in affliction and iron;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and <i>there was</i> none to help.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered <i>them</i> from their destructions.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <i>where there is</i> no way.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <i>him</i> families like a flock.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>The righteous shall see <i>it</i>, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Whoso <i>is</i> wise, and will observe these <i>things</i>, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For my love they are my adversaries: but I <i>give myself unto</i> prayer.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Let his days be few; <i>and</i> let another take his office.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <i>their bread</i> also out of their desolate places.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Let his posterity be cut off; <i>and</i> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Let it be unto him as the garment <i>which</i> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup><i>Let</i> this <i>be</i> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy <i>is</i> good, deliver thou me.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For I <i>am</i> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>I became also a reproach unto them: <i>when</i> they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>That they may know that this <i>is</i> thy hand; <i>that</i> thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <i>him</i> from those that condemn his soul.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup>God <i>is</i> the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, <i>even</i> unto the horns of the altar.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Thou <i>art</i> my God, and I will praise thee: <i>thou art</i> my God, I will exalt thee.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good: for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>I <i>am</i> a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>My soul breaketh for the longing <i>that it hath</i> unto thy judgments at all times.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Thou hast rebuked the proud <i>that are</i> cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Princes also did sit <i>and</i> speak against me: <i>but</i> thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Thy testimonies also <i>are</i> my delight <i>and</i> my counsellers.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup>I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it <i>unto</i> the end.</p>

<p><sup>43</sup>And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</p>
<p><sup>45</sup>And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>46</sup>I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>

<p><sup>48</sup>My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</p>

<p><sup>51</sup>The proud have had me greatly in derision: <i>yet</i> have I not declined from thy law.</p>
<p><sup>52</sup>I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</p>
<p><sup>53</sup>Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>
<p><sup>54</sup>Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p><sup>55</sup>I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.</p>
<p><sup>56</sup>This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>57</sup>CHETH. <i>Thou art</i> my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.</p>
<p><sup>58</sup>I intreated thy favour with <i>my</i> whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>
<p><sup>59</sup>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
<p><sup>60</sup>I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
<p><sup>61</sup>The bands of the wicked have robbed me: <i>but</i> I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p><sup>62</sup>At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p><sup>63</sup>I <i>am</i> a companion of all <i>them</i> that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>64</sup>The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>65</sup>TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p><sup>66</sup>Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
<p><sup>67</sup>Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>
<p><sup>68</sup>Thou <i>art</i> good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>69</sup>The proud have forged a lie against me: <i>but</i> I will keep thy precepts with <i>my</i> whole heart.</p>
<p><sup>70</sup>Their heart is as fat as grease; <i>but</i> I delight in thy law.</p>
<p><sup>71</sup><i>It is</i> good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>72</sup>The law of thy mouth <i>is</i> better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p><sup>73</sup>JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</p>
<p><sup>74</sup>They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>
<p><sup>75</sup>I know, O LORD, that thy judgments <i>are</i> right, and <i>that</i> thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</p>
<p><sup>76</sup>Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>
<p><sup>77</sup>Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law <i>is</i> my delight.</p>
<p><sup>78</sup>Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: <i>but</i> I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>

<p><sup>82</sup>Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
<p><sup>83</sup>For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; <i>yet</i> do I not forget thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>84</sup>How many <i>are</i> the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
<p><sup>85</sup>The proud have digged pits for me, which <i>are</i> not after thy law.</p>
<p><sup>86</sup>All thy commandments <i>are</i> faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>
<p><sup>87</sup>They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>88</sup>Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>
<p><sup>89</sup>LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
<p><sup>90</sup>Thy faithfulness <i>is</i> unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
<p><sup>91</sup>They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all <i>are</i> thy servants.</p>
<p><sup>92</sup>Unless thy law <i>had been</i> my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>
<p><sup>93</sup>I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>
<p><sup>94</sup>I <i>am</i> thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>95</sup>The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: <i>but</i> I will consider thy testimonies.</p>
<p><sup>96</sup>I have seen an end of all perfection: <i>but</i> thy commandment <i>is</i> exceeding broad.</p>
<p><sup>97</sup>MEM. O how love I thy law! it <i>is</i> my meditation all the day.</p>
<p><sup>98</sup>Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they <i>are</i> ever with me.</p>
<p><sup>99</sup>I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies <i>are</i> my meditation.</p>
<p><sup>100</sup>I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>101</sup>I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>
<p><sup>102</sup>I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>
<p><sup>103</sup>How sweet are thy words unto my taste! <i>yea, sweeter</i> than honey to my mouth!</p>
<p><sup>104</sup>Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>
<p><sup>105</sup>NUN. Thy word <i>is</i> a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
<p><sup>106</sup>I have sworn, and I will perform <i>it</i>, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p><sup>107</sup>I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p><sup>108</sup>Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</p>
<p><sup>109</sup>My soul <i>is</i> continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>
<p><sup>110</sup>The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>111</sup>Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they <i>are</i> the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
<p><sup>112</sup>I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, <i>even unto</i> the end.</p>
<p><sup>113</sup>SAMECH. I hate <i>vain</i> thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>

<p><sup>115</sup>Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>
<p><sup>116</sup>Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
<p><sup>117</sup>Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
<p><sup>118</sup>Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit <i>is</i> falsehood.</p>
<p><sup>119</sup>Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth <i>like</i> dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
<p><sup>120</sup>My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
<p><sup>121</sup>AIN. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>
<p><sup>122</sup>Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>
<p><sup>123</sup>Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>
<p><sup>124</sup>Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>125</sup>I <i>am</i> thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
<p><sup>126</sup><i>It is</i> time for <i>thee</i>, LORD, to work: <i>for</i> they have made void thy law.</p>

<p><sup>128</sup>Therefore I esteem all <i>thy</i> precepts <i>concerning</i> all <i>things to be</i> right; <i>and</i> I hate every false way.</p>
<p><sup>129</sup>PE. Thy testimonies <i>are</i> wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>
<p><sup>130</sup>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
<p><sup>131</sup>I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>
<p><sup>132</sup>Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>
<p><sup>133</sup>Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
<p><sup>134</sup>Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p><sup>135</sup>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><sup>136</sup>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>

<p><sup>140</sup>Thy word <i>is</i> very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
<p><sup>141</sup>I <i>am</i> small and despised: <i>yet</i> do not I forget thy precepts.</p>

<p><sup>147</sup>I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
<p><sup>148</sup>Mine eyes prevent the <i>night</i> watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>
<p><sup>149</sup>Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>

<h3>Psalm 130</h3>

<p><sup>4</sup>But <i>there is</i> forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p>

<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, <i>and</i> all his afflictions:</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I will not give sleep to mine eyes, <i>or</i> slumber to mine eyelids,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty <i>God</i> of Jacob.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD hath sworn <i>in</i> truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired <i>it</i> for his habitation.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>This <i>is</i> my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</p>

<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known <i>me</i>.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted <i>with</i> all my ways.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>For <i>there is</i> not a word in my tongue, <i>but</i>, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup><i>Such</i> knowledge <i>is</i> too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot <i>attain</i> unto it.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>If I ascend up into heaven, thou <i>art</i> there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou <i>art there</i>.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup><i>If</i> I take the wings of the morning, <i>and</i> dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light <i>are</i> both alike <i>to thee</i>.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>I will praise thee; for I am fearfully <i>and</i> wonderfully made: marvellous <i>are</i> thy works; and <i>that</i> my soul knoweth right well.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, <i>and</i> curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all <i>my members</i> were written, <i>which</i> in continuance were fashioned, when <i>as yet there was</i> none of them.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</p>
<p><sup>18</sup><i>If</i> I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>For they speak against thee wickedly, <i>and</i> thine enemies take <i>thy name</i> in vain.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>He giveth to the beast his food, <i>and</i> to the young ravens which cry.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>He maketh peace <i>in</i> thy borders, <i>and</i> filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>He sendeth forth his commandment <i>upon</i> earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, <i>and</i> the waters flow.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>He hath not dealt so with any nation: and <i>as for his</i> judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
