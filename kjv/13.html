<p><sup>2</sup>For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him <i>came</i> the chief ruler; but the birthright <i>was</i> Joseph’s:)</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The sons, <i>I say</i>, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel <i>were</i>, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away <i>captive</i>: he <i>was</i> prince of the Reubenites.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, <i>were</i> the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east <i>land</i> of Gilead.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah:</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And their brethren of the house of their fathers <i>were</i>, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>These <i>are</i> the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, <i>were</i> four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that <i>were</i> with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For there fell down many slain, because the war <i>was</i> of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>And these <i>were</i> the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, <i>and</i> heads of the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And the porters <i>were</i>, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum <i>was</i> the chief;</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Who hitherto <i>waited</i> in the king’s gate eastward: they <i>were</i> porters in the companies of the children of Levi.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, <i>were</i> over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, <i>being</i> over the host of the LORD, <i>were</i> keepers of the entry.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, <i>and</i> the LORD <i>was</i> with him.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup><i>And</i> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah <i>was</i> porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>All these <i>which were</i> chosen to be porters in the gates <i>were</i> two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>So they and their children <i>had</i> the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, <i>namely</i>, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>And their brethren, <i>which were</i> in their villages, <i>were</i> to come after seven days from time to time with them.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in <i>their</i> set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge <i>was</i> upon them, and the opening thereof every morning <i>pertained</i> to them.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>And <i>certain</i> of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup><i>Some</i> of them also <i>were</i> appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>And <i>some</i> of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>And Mattithiah, <i>one</i> of the Levites, who <i>was</i> the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>And <i>other</i> of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, <i>were</i> over the shewbread, to prepare <i>it</i> every sabbath.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>And these <i>are</i> the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, <i>who remaining</i> in the chambers <i>were</i> free: for they were employed in <i>that</i> work day and night.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>These chief fathers of the Levites <i>were</i> chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s name <i>was</i> Maachah:</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>And the son of Jonathan <i>was</i> Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>And the sons of Micah <i>were</i>, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, <i>and Ahaz</i>.</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.</p>
<p><sup>44</sup>And Azel had six sons, whose names <i>are</i> these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these <i>were</i> the sons of Azel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And when all the men of Israel that <i>were</i> in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, <i>even</i> against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking <i>counsel</i> of <i>one that had</i> a familiar spirit, to inquire <i>of it</i>;</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <i>was</i> with him.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i>by him</i> at one time.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was one</i> of the three mighties.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And David <i>was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison <i>was</i> then at Bethlehem.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>is</i> at the gate!</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the LORD,</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i>the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <i>them</i>, and had a name among the three.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i>first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Also the valiant men of the armies <i>were</i>, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, <i>that pertained</i> to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now these <i>are</i> they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they <i>were</i> among the mighty men, helpers of the war.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup><i>They were</i> armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in <i>hurling</i> stones and <i>shooting</i> arrows out of a bow, <i>even</i> of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The chief <i>was</i> Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, <i>and</i> men of war <i>fit</i> for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces <i>were like</i> the faces of lions, and <i>were</i> as swift as the roes upon the mountains;</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>These <i>were</i> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least <i>was</i> over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>These <i>are</i> they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all <i>them</i> of the valleys, <i>both</i> toward the east, and toward the west.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if <i>ye be come</i> to betray me to mine enemies, seeing <i>there is</i> no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look <i>thereon</i>, and rebuke <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Then the spirit came upon Amasai, <i>who was</i> chief of the captains, <i>and he said</i>, Thine <i>are we</i>, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace <i>be</i> unto thee, and peace <i>be</i> to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And there fell <i>some</i> of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to <i>the jeopardy of</i> our heads.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that <i>were</i> of Manasseh.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And they helped David against the band <i>of the rovers</i>: for they <i>were</i> all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For at <i>that</i> time day by day there came to David to help him, until <i>it was</i> a great host, like the host of God.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And these <i>are</i> the numbers of the bands <i>that were</i> ready armed to the war, <i>and</i> came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>The children of Judah that bare shield and spear <i>were</i> six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>And Jehoiada <i>was</i> the leader of the Aaronites, and with him <i>were</i> three thousand and seven hundred;</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>And of the children of Issachar, <i>which were men</i> that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them <i>were</i> two hundred; and all their brethren <i>were</i> at their commandment.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: <i>they were</i> not of double heart.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel <i>were</i> of one heart to make David king.</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>Moreover they that were nigh them, <i>even</i> unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, <i>and</i> meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for <i>there was</i> joy in Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i>it seem</i> good unto you, and <i>that it be</i> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i>that are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that is</i>, to Kirjathjearim, which <i>belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i>on it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <i>home</i> to me?</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>So David brought not the ark <i>home</i> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Now these <i>are</i> the names of <i>his</i> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <i>of it</i>, and went out against them.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <i>that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <i>both</i> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <i>the place that</i> I have prepared for it.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>For because ye <i>did it</i> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>And with them their brethren of the second <i>degree</i>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass;</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i>was</i> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <i>was</i> skilful.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>And David <i>was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <i>had</i> upon him an ephod of linen.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>And it came to pass, <i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine</i>.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And he appointed <i>certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Then on that day David delivered first <i>this psalm</i> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>He <i>is</i> the LORD our God; his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations;</p>
<p><sup>16</sup><i>Even of the covenant</i> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant,</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And <i>when</i> they went from nation to nation, and from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>
<p><sup>22</sup><i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>For great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <i>is</i> to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For all the gods of the people <i>are</i> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Glory and honour <i>are</i> in his presence; strength and gladness <i>are</i> in his place.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Give unto the LORD the glory <i>due</i> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <i>men</i> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <i>is</i> therein.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup>O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <i>and</i> glory in thy praise.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>37</sup>So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required:</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i>to be</i> porters:</p>
<p><sup>39</sup>And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon,</p>
<p><sup>40</sup>To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <i>to do</i> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever;</p>
<p><sup>42</sup>And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <i>were</i> porters.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i>are</i> in the earth.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <i>am</i> I, O LORD God, and what <i>is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>O LORD, <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i>to be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel: and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <i>it shall be</i> blessed for ever.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot <i>horses</i>, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <i>with him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <i>these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <i>were</i> chief about the king.</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Then there went <i>certain</i>, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And when David heard <i>of it</i>, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set <i>themselves</i> in array against the children of Ammon.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do <i>that which is</i> good in his sight.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that <i>were</i> beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set <i>the battle</i> in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand <i>men which fought in</i> chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out <i>to battle</i>, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And he brought out the people that <i>were</i> in it, and cut <i>them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, <i>that was</i> of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff <i>was</i> like a weaver’s beam.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of <i>great</i> stature, whose fingers and toes <i>were</i> four and twenty, six <i>on each hand</i>, and six <i>on each foot</i>: and he also was the son of the giant.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they <i>be</i>: but, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all <i>they of</i> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three <i>things</i>: choose thee one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh <i>thee</i>; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great <i>are</i> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <i>of Israel, who were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And David said unto God, <i>Is it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <i>as for</i> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And Ornan said unto David, Take <i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do <i>that which is</i> good in his eyes: lo, I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, <i>were</i> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Then David said, This <i>is</i> the house of the LORD God, and this <i>is</i> the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And David commanded to gather together the strangers that <i>were</i> in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And David said, Solomon my son <i>is</i> young and tender, and the house <i>that is</i> to be builded for the LORD <i>must be</i> exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will <i>therefore</i> now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I <i>will be</i> his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Moreover <i>there are</i> workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, <i>there is</i> no number. Arise <i>therefore</i>, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><sup>18</sup><i>Is</i> not the LORD your God with you? and hath he <i>not</i> given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Of which, twenty and four thousand <i>were</i> to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand <i>were</i> officers and judges:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Moreover four thousand <i>were</i> porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, <i>said David</i>, to praise <i>therewith</i>.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, <i>namely</i>, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Of the Gershonites <i>were</i>, Laadan, and Shimei.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The sons of Laadan; the chief <i>was</i> Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These <i>were</i> the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>And the sons of Shimei <i>were</i>, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four <i>were</i> the sons of Shimei.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to <i>their</i> father’s house.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>Now <i>concerning</i> Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The sons of Moses <i>were</i>, Gershom, and Eliezer.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel <i>was</i> the chief.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>And the sons of Eliezer <i>were</i>, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>These <i>were</i> the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; <i>even</i> the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>And also unto the Levites; they shall no <i>more</i> carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>For by the last words of David the Levites <i>were</i> numbered from twenty years old and above:</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Because their office <i>was</i> to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for <i>that which is baked in</i> the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy <i>place</i>, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Now <i>these are</i> the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and <i>thus</i> were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar <i>there were</i> sixteen chief men of the house of <i>their</i> fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors <i>of the house</i> of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <i>one</i> of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <i>before</i> the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and <i>one</i> taken for Ithamar.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,</p>

<p><sup>17</sup>The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>These <i>were</i> the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And the rest of the sons of Levi <i>were these</i>: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first <i>was</i> Isshiah.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>And the sons <i>of Hebron</i>; Jeriah <i>the first</i>, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup><i>Of</i> the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The brother of Michah <i>was</i> Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>The sons of Merari <i>were</i> Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>Of Mahli <i>came</i> Eleazar, who had no sons.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Concerning Kish: the son of Kish <i>was</i> Jerahmeel.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These <i>were</i> the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup>All these <i>were</i> the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup>Among these <i>were</i> the divisions of the porters, <i>even</i> among the chief men, <i>having</i> wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counseller, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: <i>As for me</i>, I <i>had</i> in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou <i>hast been</i> a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah <i>to be</i> the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make <i>me</i> king over all Israel:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him <i>to be</i> my son, and I will be his father.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave <i>it</i> for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup><i>He gave</i> of gold by weight for <i>things</i> of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; <i>silver also</i> for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, <i>both</i> for the candlestick, and <i>also</i> for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>And by weight <i>he gave</i> gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and <i>likewise</i> silver for the tables of silver:</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons <i>he gave gold</i> by weight for every bason; and <i>likewise silver</i> by weight for every bason of silver:</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out <i>their wings</i>, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>All <i>this, said David</i>, the LORD made me understand in writing by <i>his</i> hand upon me, <i>even</i> all the works of this pattern.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do <i>it</i>: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, <i>even</i> my God, <i>will be</i> with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, <i>even they shall be with thee</i> for all the service of the house of God: and <i>there shall be</i> with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people <i>will be</i> wholly at thy commandment.</p>

<h3>Chapter 29</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup>Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, <i>is yet</i> young and tender, and the work <i>is</i> great: for the palace <i>is</i> not for man, but for the LORD God.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for <i>things to be made</i> of gold, and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver, and the brass for <i>things</i> of brass, the iron for <i>things</i> of iron, and wood for <i>things</i> of wood; onyx stones, and <i>stones</i> to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, <i>which</i> I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</p>
<p><sup>4</sup><i>Even</i> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses <i>withal</i>:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>The gold for <i>things</i> of gold, and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver, and for all manner of work <i>to be made</i> by the hands of artificers. And who <i>then</i> is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly,</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>And they with whom <i>precious</i> stones were found gave <i>them</i> to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed <i>be</i> thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Thine, O LORD, <i>is</i> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all <i>that is</i> in the heaven and in the earth <i>is thine</i>; thine <i>is</i> the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Both riches and honour <i>come</i> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand <i>is</i> power and might; and in thine hand <i>it is</i> to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>But who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things <i>come</i> of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>For we <i>are</i> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as <i>were</i> all our fathers: our days on the earth <i>are</i> as a shadow, and <i>there is</i> none abiding.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name <i>cometh</i> of thine hand, and <i>is</i> all thine own.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all <i>these things</i>, and to build the palace, <i>for</i> the which I have made provision.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, <i>even</i> a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, <i>and</i> a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed <i>him</i> unto the LORD <i>to be</i> the chief governor, and Zadok <i>to be</i> priest.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him <i>such</i> royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>And the time that he reigned over Israel <i>was</i> forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three <i>years</i> reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</p>
<p><sup>30</sup>With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
